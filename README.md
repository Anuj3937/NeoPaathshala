**Build the next generation of intelligent agents to empower teachers in multi-grade classrooms.**

## üßê The Problem

* **Teacher Burnout:** Teachers often spend 60-90 minutes preparing for a single lesson. They struggle to meet diverse student needs due to the immense time and effort required to create varied, personalized materials.
* **One-Size-Fits-All Doesn't Work:** Generic educational content often fails to engage students because it lacks cultural relevance and cannot cater to varied learning styles.
* **The Multi-Grade Challenge:** Over 10.2% of schools in India have one teacher responsible for educating multiple grades simultaneously, placing an enormous strain on them to deliver different lessons effectively.
* **Critical Learning Gaps:** Only half of rural Grade 5 students can read texts at a Grade 2 level, highlighting an urgent need for better assessments, personalized learning, and focused support.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm installed
* A Firebase account and a new project created
* Access to Google Cloud Platform for API keys (Gemini, Cloud Translate)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/neopaathshaala.git](https://github.com/your-username/neopaathshaala.git)
    cd neopaathshaala
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    * Navigate to your Firebase project settings.
    * Get your Firebase configuration object (apiKey, authDomain, etc.).
    * Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
    * Add your Firebase configuration to the `.env.local` file. **Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project keys.**
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=""
    MAPS_API = ""
    SUPPABASE_PWD = ""
    ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = ""
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
    SECRET_KEY="" # Generate a random string for this
    ```

4.  **Set up Backend Functions:**
    * Navigate to the `functions` directory (`cd functions`).
    * Install backend dependencies: `npm install`.
    * Set up your environment variables for the Gemini API key using Firebase Functions configuration:
    ```sh
    firebase functions:config:set gemini.key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    * Go back to the root directory (`cd ..`).
    * Start the Vite development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
