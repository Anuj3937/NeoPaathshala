# NeoPaathshaala

**Build the next generation of intelligent agents to empower teachers in multi-grade classrooms.**

NeoPaathshaala is an AI-powered platform designed to support teachers, especially those in the challenging environment of multi-grade classrooms in rural India. It addresses the critical issues of teacher burnout, the shortage of educators, and the need for personalized, engaging, and culturally relevant educational content.

## üßê The Problem

* **Teacher Burnout:** Teachers often spend 60-90 minutes preparing for a single lesson. They struggle to meet diverse student needs due to the immense time and effort required to create varied, personalized materials.
* **One-Size-Fits-All Doesn't Work:** Generic educational content often fails to engage students because it lacks cultural relevance and cannot cater to varied learning styles.
* **The Multi-Grade Challenge:** Over 10.2% of schools in India have one teacher responsible for educating multiple grades simultaneously, placing an enormous strain on them to deliver different lessons effectively.
* **Critical Learning Gaps:** Only half of rural Grade 5 students can read texts at a Grade 2 level, highlighting an urgent need for better assessments, personalized learning, and focused support.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is structured into two main folders: `app` (Python backend) and `neo` (React frontend). Follow the steps below to get both services running locally.
### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm installed
* A Firebase account and a new project created
* Access to Google Cloud Platform for API keys (Gemini, Cloud Translate)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Anuj3937/NeoPaathshala.git
    cd NeoPaathshala
    ```
### 1. Backend Setup (`app` folder)

The backend is a Python application that serves the core AI logic.

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
    Open your terminal and navigate into the `app` folder.
    ```sh
    cd app
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies.
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Required Packages:**
    With your virtual environment activated, install all the necessary Python packages.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    * Inside the `app` folder, create a new file named `.env`.
    * Copy the following keys into the file and fill in your values.

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=""
    MAPS_API=""
    SUPPABASE_PWD=""
    ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=""
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
    SECRET_KEY=""
    ```
    **Note:** For `SECRET_KEY`, you can generate a secure random string. One way is to run this in a Python shell: `import secrets; secrets.token_hex(32)`.

5.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    Use `uvicorn` to run the FastAPI application. The `--reload` flag automatically restarts the server when you save code changes.
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend API should now be running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup (`neo` folder)

The frontend is a React application built with Vite.

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
    In a **new terminal window**, navigate into the `neo` folder.
    ```sh
    cd neo
    ```

2.  **Install NPM Dependencies:**
    Install all the necessary Node.js packages.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Frontend Application:**
    Start the frontend development server.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The React application should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to use NeoPaathshala.

## üîÆ Future Scope

* **LMS Integration:** Allow teachers to directly export lesson plans and resources into popular Learning Management Systems like Google Classroom.
* **Student-Facing Quizzes:** Expand content generation to include interactive quizzes and assessments that can be directly administered to students.
* **Analytics & Feedback Loop:** Provide teachers with insights into content effectiveness and allow them to give feedback to fine-tune the AI models.
* **Parallel Task Processing:** Implement parallel processing to generate multiple content types simultaneously, drastically reducing wait times.
